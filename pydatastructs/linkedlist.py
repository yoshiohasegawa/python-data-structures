# File Description
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is a class for the Linked List data structure. It is a data structure 
# containing nodes. When this class is instantiated, the head node is created
# only if a value is provided. Additionally, if a value is provided, the tail 
# property will be assigned to the head node since there will only be one node
# to begin with. Otherwise, the head and tail properties are are assigned
# None. Each node has a value property and, a next property which points to
# the next node.
